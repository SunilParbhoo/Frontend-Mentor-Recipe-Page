## My process

I attempted to make this site responsive using HTML and CSS without the use of flexbox or CSS grid. With this project, I wanted to practice utilizing other methods to make a responsive design while also limiting myself to just one media query. This was in an attempt to try to allow the browser to respond rather than adding superfluous code that may not be necessary to achieve the end goal. I hope that with this project, I have come one step closer to achieving this.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Single Media Query

### What I learned

Sometimes, less is more. I was able to complete this responsive site without the use of flexbox, relying instead on a single media query and avoiding adding CSS that may not be necessary,such as body{ height: 100vh;}, instead opting for min-height. This also helps reduce overflow at different screen sizes.

### Continued development

I will continue to improve my development of responsive layouts by utilizing modern CSS3 standards, and when necessary, CSS frameworks.
